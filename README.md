In CrazyAra v.0.1.0 the Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (MCTS) was imported and adapted from the following project: 
* https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero

For CrazyAra v.0.2.0 the MCTS was rewritten from scratch adding new functionality:
* Reusing the old search tree for future positions
* Node and child-nodes structure using numpy-arrays
* Always using mate-in-one connection if possible in the current search tree
