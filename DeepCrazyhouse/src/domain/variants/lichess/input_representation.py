    Gets the plane representation of a given board state.

    ## Chess Variants:

    Feature | Planes

    --- | ---

    P1 piece | 6 (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING)

    P2 piece | 6 (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING)

    Repetitions | 2 (two planes (full zeros/ones) indicating how often the board positions has occurred)

    P1 prisoner count | 5 (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN) (excluding the KING)

    P2 prisoner count | 5 (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN) (excluding the KING)

    P1 Promoted Pawns Mask | 1 (binary map indicating the pieces which have been promoted)

    P2 Promoted Pawns Mask | 1 (binary map indicating the pieces which have been promoted)

    En-passant square | 1 (Binary map indicating the square where en-passant capture is possible)

    Colour | 1 (all zeros for black and all ones for white)

    Total move count | 1 (integer value setting the move count (uci notation))

    P1 castling | 2 (One if castling is possible, else zero)

    P2 castling | 2 (One if castling is possible, else zero)

    No-progress count | 1 (Setting the no progress counter as integer values, (described by uci halfmoves format)

    P1 remaining-checks | 2 (only needed for the 3check variant, after 3 checks by one player the game ends)

    P2 remaining-checks | 2 (only needed for the 3check variant, after 3 checks by one player the game ends)
