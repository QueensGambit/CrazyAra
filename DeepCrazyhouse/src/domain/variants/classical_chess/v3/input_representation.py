    P2 piece | 6 (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN, KING)

    Repetitions | 2 (two planes (full zeros/ones) indicating how often the board positions has occurred)

    En-passant square | 1 (Binary map indicating the square where en-passant capture is possible)

    15 planes

    * * *

    P1 castling | 2 (One if castling is possible, else zero)

    P2 castling | 2 (One if castling is possible, else zero)

    No-progress count | 1 (Setting the no progress counter as integer values, (described by uci halfmoves format)

    ---
    5 planes

    * * *

    Last 8 moves | 16 (indicated by origin and destination square, the most recent move is described by first 2 planes)

    Checkerboard | 1 | A chess board pattern |
    P1 Material Diff | 5 | (pieces are ordered: PAWN, KNIGHT, BISHOP, ROOK, QUEEN), normalized with 8, + means positive, - means negative |
    Opposite Color Bishops | 1 | Indicates if they are only two bishops and the bishops are opposite color |
