Description of the alpha zero architecture for pytorch:
Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge, Silver et al.
'The input features st are processed by a residual tower that consists of a single
convolutional block followed by either 19 or 39 residual blocks.
The convolutional block applies the following modules:
(1) A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×​3 with stride 1
(2) Batch normalization 18
(3) A rectifier nonlinearity
Each residual block applies the following modules sequentially to its input:
(1) A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×​3 with stride 1
(2) Batch normalization
(3) A rectifier nonlinearity
(4) A convolution of 256 filters of kernel size 3 ×​3 with stride 1
(5) Batch normalization
(6) A skip connection that adds the input to the block
(7) A rectifier nonlinearity
The output of the residual tower is passed into two separate ‘heads’ for
computing the policy and value. The policy head applies the following modules:
(1) A convolution of 2 filters of kernel size 1 ×​1 with stride 1
(2) Batch normalization
(3) A rectifier nonlinearity
(4) A fully connected linear layer that outputs a vector of size 192 +​ 1 =​ 362,
corresponding to logistic probabilities for all intersections and the pass move
The value head applies the following modules:
(1) A convolution of 1 filter of kernel size 1 ×​1 with stride 1
(2) Batch normalization
(3) A rectifier nonlinearity
(4) A fully connected linear layer to a hidden layer of size 256
(5) A rectifier nonlinearity
(6) A fully connected linear layer to a scalar
(7) A tanh nonlinearity outputting a scalar in the range [−​1, 1]
The overall network depth, in the 20- or 40-block network, is 39 or 79 parameterized layers, respectively,
for the residual tower, plus an additional 2 layers for the policy head and 3 layers for the value head.
We note that a different variant of residual networks was simultaneously applied
to computer Go33 and achieved an amateur dan-level performance; however, this
was restricted to a single-headed policy network trained solely by supervised learning.
Neural network architecture comparison. Figure 4 shows the results of a comparison between network architectures.
Specifically, we compared four different neural networks:
(1) dual–res: the network contains a 20-block residual tower, as described above,
followed by both a policy head and a value head. This is the architecture used in AlphaGo Zero.
(2) sep–res: the network contains two 20-block residual towers. The first tower
is followed by a policy head and the second tower is followed by a value head.
(3) dual–conv: the network contains a non-residual tower of 12 convolutional
blocks, followed by both a policy head and a value head.
(4) sep–conv: the network contains two non-residual towers of 12 convolutional
blocks. The first tower is followed by a policy head and the second tower is followed
by a value head. This is the architecture used in AlphaGo Lee.
Each network was trained on a fixed dataset containing the final 2 million
games of self-play data generated by a previous run of AlphaGo Zero, using
stochastic gradient descent with the annealing rate, momentum and regularization hyperparameters described for
the supervised learning experiment; however, cross-entropy and MSE components were weighted equally,
since more data was available.'
